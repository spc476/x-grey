I just deleted a tuple (whitelist or greylist), yet I'm still getting emails
through.  What's up with that?

	The entry is only marked for deletion.  It won't actually be deleted
	until the next cleanup period (default: 5m).  They're still active
	in the tuple list, but only the MCP "show tuples all" command will
	show them.

Why is the value of From-Domain-Greylisted significantly lower than
From-Greylisted?  

	That's because the sender address might not neccessarily contain a
	domain.  Local delivery for one thing.  Another are bounce messages
	that come from an address of "<>", which is legal.

Why is the value of To-Domain-Greylisted lower than To-Greylisted?

	Similarly to the above question, the recipient address might not
	neccessarily contain a domain.
