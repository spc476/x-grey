Look at using SA_RESTART for signals.

use pipe() to create a pipe.  epoll() on the read end. have the signals that
do stuff other than exit, write the signal number to the write end of the
pipe.  The readend gets notified of data, and we dispatch on that.  That
way, we don't have to busy-check the signals we're interested in.


format for whitelist:
	time ip from to
	...

reading in whitelist:

	Zen = mtime of tile
	Tao = now
	d   = Tao - Zen

	for each entry in whitelist
		read in
		adjust time by d
		if > c_timeout_whitelist reject
