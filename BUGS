	* log "cu-expire: n" doesn't log what I think it logs.

		CLOSED 2011-11-22

		Removed code.

	* GLD receives SIGABRT when reading from-domain.txt, from.txt,
	      to-domain.txt and to.txt.  Need to check the code for this.
	
		CLOSED 2011-11-21

		Patched code for now.  I need to fix edomain_search() to
		use bisearch().

		UPDATE 2011-11-21

		Code updated.

	* Under OpenBSD, bulk transfers (via TCP) sometimes fail.

		I suspect what's happening is that I assume that TCP port
		9990 (or whatever is used) is available for use and just
		try to bind to it, when it isn't actually available.  I
		think I may just bind to any available port and send that
		port along with the UDP response, but that would require
		an update of the communications protocol.

	* when removing tuples, the counts might not be adjusted properly
		CLOSED	2009-12-02

		Upon reviewing the code, the counts are adjusted during the
		periodic sweep, not when actually removed.  I don't remember
		why this was even put in as a bug.

	* tried doing 'to reject blah@example.com' and GLD just stopped
	  responding.  Hmmm?  This after running for a week.
		FIXED	2009-02-17	(v1.0.7 fixes this)

	* PFC segfaults on a blank line (found by Mark Grosberg)
		FIXED	2007-11-13

	  the correct 'install-server' and 'install-postfix' (Kelly Fallon)
		FIXED	2007-11-13

	* INSTALL file does not mention changes needed to postfix/mail.cf
	  (Mark Grosbert)
		FIXED	2007-11-13

	* too many threads in smc caused it to quit?  Is that part of
	  sendmail's general policy of shutting down when the system
	  load gets too high?

		FIXED - 2008-04-16 (I hope)

		REOPENED - 2008-04-16

		FIXED - 2007-11-06
	
		libmilter creates a ton of threads, each thread using a ton
		of memory.  I added code to limit stack space in SMC.

	* apparent bug where if whitelist.ip didn't end in a newline,
	  program would crash

	* Either restore the counts, or set them back to zero when
	  restarting.

	* When removing an IFT entry, adjust count accordingly.

	* Around 6 hours, saving state fails for some reason.

        * if the child process segfaults, then the program is restarted,
          which is not what I want.  FIXED

        * can't add to an empty iplist for some reason.  And g_ipcnt is
        wrong in that case.     FIXED

        * doing 'iplist * 0.0.0.0/0 crashes the program.
		FIXED

2007-09-15T01:32-05:00
	* duplicates in the whitelist.txt aren't detected and removed.
		DONE 2007-10-27T22:41-05:00 doesn't seem to be a problem.
		probably fixed in some earlier incarnation.

	* Check memory allocations, I may have a small leak
		DONE - there are none (using valgrind)

	* I think the help message on the server is incorrect.

*	If whitelist.ip doesn't end in a linefeed, it segfaults.
		FIXED 2007-10-27T22:38-05:00

*	There's a problem under Linux 2.6.9-023stab032.1-smp with fork(). At
	first, I thought it was the calls to _exit() were failing, but nope,
	it's with exit() as well.  I'm thinking I may have a long term
	problem.  I hope I don't have a long term problem.  That would suck.
