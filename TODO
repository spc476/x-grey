	* maybe have the ability to add stuff to the whitelist, iplist, etc.
	  via network requests

	* have some way of removing a whitelist entry?

	* check memory allocations---I may have a small leak somewhere

	* make a configuation file---the command line is getting a bit
	  silly.

	* keep track of unique IP, create time, last activity time, number
	  of requests, number of whitelist.

*	Have gld reread the whitelist.ip file, for on-the-fly updates.

	Problem caused by:  The Apache mailing list, which uses a unique
	email address for every message sent out.  I'm not sure if I'll
	get any more or not.

*	Tune down the accept maybe?  cybercom tried again in 22 minutes.

*	Make a /var/run/pid file for daemon.

*	If run as root, switch down to a particular user.

*	Report running time on various reports

*	Keep track of unique IP addresses.  If an address has only
	graylisted addresses and no whitelisted addresses, add it to the IP
	reject list.  But let me think about this.  

*	Make the dump.txt and whitelist.txt have the same format.  Modify
	the iplist_load() to ignore anything past the recipient address. 
	Then I can reload a dump and pick up from there.  Or have
	iplist_load() read in the extra fields to recreate the entire list. 
	Would make upading the server a bit smoother.

*	Investigate maybe using only from and to address, and skip the IP
	address.
