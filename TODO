	* MCP:  Detect if the pager is available, and if not, use the
	  built-in pager.

2007-11-03T14:22-05:00

	* need to move the 'obj/' directories to 'build/' directories
	  becuase gcc/make on OpenBSD does wierd things when you try to use
	  a directory called 'obj/'.
		DONE	2007-11-03

	* Also, finish replacing <arpa/inet.h> with <netinet/in.h>
		DONE	2007-11-03

	* Document PAGER stuff.
		DONE	2007-11-03

2007-10-30

	* remove IFT entries
		DONE

	* "show tuples" "show tuples all" and "show tuples whitelist"
	   now distinct commands
		DONE

2007-10-27T05:47-05:00

	* Add/remove tuples from the MCP.
		DONE

2007-10-17T23:14-05:00

	* on brevard, changed SIGCHLD to be handled like any other normal
	  signal.
		DONE
	
	* Also fixed some possible problems with handle_sigchld
	* simplified code dealing with gld_fork().
		DONE

	* next to try:
		* renaming state files
		* saving state without the fork
		DONE - no longer need to do this.

2007-10-03T02:33-05:00

	* Fix pfc to accept---oh, I see I already have that on the todo
	  list.  Sigh.
		DONE

2007-09-26T15:22-05:00

	* smc: cleanup c_filterchannel when program ends.
 	* smc: make into daemon (and all that entails)
		DONE

	* pfc: add code to actually contact a remote host
		DONE
	
2007-09-22T03:03-05:00

	* Add IP restrictions on who can connect.
		DONE - no longer under consideration.  Use iptables.

2007-09-21T20:17-05:00

	* Possibly add code to filter requests from certain IP addresses.
		DONE - no longer under consideration.  Use iptables.

2007-09-17T03:05-05:00

        * when adding an IP list, remove records that match the IP address.

        * Remove IPs that are more specific but repeat less specific IPs,
        for instance,

                iplist accept 10.10.10/24
                iplist reject 10.10/16
                iplist reject 10/8

        when the third one is added, the second one can be removed.

2007-09-15T04:28-05:00

        * add code for a pager
                DONE

2007-09-11T05:15-05:00

        * maybe have the ability to add stuff to the whitelist, iplist, etc.
          via network requests
		DONE 2007-09-21T20:00-05:00

2007-09-07T03:10-05:00

	* have some way of removing a whitelist entry?

	* check memory allocations---I may have a small leak somewhere
		DONE 2007-09-21-T20:00-05:00

	* make a configuation file---the command line is getting a bit
	  silly.
		DONE - no longer under consideration

	* keep track of unique IP, create time, last activity time, number
	  of requests, number of whitelist.

2007-09-06T00:16-05:00

	* Have gld reread the whitelist.ip file, for on-the-fly updates.
		DONE 2007-09-21T20:00-05:00

	  Problem caused by:  The Apache mailing list, which uses a unique
	  email address for every message sent out.  I'm not sure if I'll
	  get any more or not.
		SOLVED

	* Tune down the accept maybe?  cybercom tried again in 22 minutes.
		DONE

	* Make a /var/run/pid file for daemon.
		DONE	2007-09-08T03:55-05:00

	* If run as root, switch down to a particular user.

	* Report running time on various reports
		DONE

	* Keep track of unique IP addresses.  If an address has only
	  graylisted addresses and no whitelisted addresses, add it to the
	  IP reject list.  But let me think about this.

	* Make the dump.txt and whitelist.txt have the same format.  Modify
	  the iplist_load() to ignore anything past the recipient address. 
	  Then I can reload a dump and pick up from there.  Or have
	  iplist_load() read in the extra fields to recreate the entire
	  list.  Would make upading the server a bit smoother.
		DONE

	* Investigate maybe using only from and to address, and skip the IP
	  address.
		DONE - no longer under consideration, using IP address.
