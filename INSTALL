To install the greylist daemon:

Dependencies:

	All programs require the CGILIB library I wrote.  The latest version
	is available at:

		http://www.conman.org/software/cgilib/cgilib.tar.gz

	All programs require the GNU getopt library, or an equivilent
	replacement.

	The "gld-mcp" program requires the GNU readline package.  The latest
	version of that is available at:

		http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html

	The "smc" (sendmail client) requires the milter and pthreads
	library.  You are on your own for installing milter and pthreads.
	Sorry.

Extraction:

	If you're reading this, you've already extracted the files. 
	Congratulations!

Compilation:

	Edit both the top level Makefile and conf.h to reflect your system's
	layout and preferences.  Once you are satisified with the parameter
	settings, you can then compile the program.  One setting you may
	need to set is MCP_PAGER in conf.h---this is the location of your
	favorite pagination program.

	To compile and install the server portion:

		make server
		make server-install

	This will make the server and the Master Control Program, and
	install them (default: /usr/local/bin).  It will also install some
	help files used by the MCP program (default: /usr/local/share/gld).


	If you are using Postfix:

		make postfix
		make install-install

	If you are using Sendmail:

		make sendmail
		make install-sendmail

	If you are using Qmail:

		I feel sorry for you.

Installation and starting the various programs:

	Server:

		There's a sample startup script for the server in the
		scripts directory.  It was written for a SysV type system
		(okay, RedHat Linux and derivatives) but it will give you an
		indication of how the server is started.  Basically, it's
		just "./gld" but you can use the command line options to
		override the built-in defaults ("gld --help" for more
		inforamtion).

		To start the gld process:

			# /usr/local/bin/gld

		To stop the gld process:

			# kill `cat /var/run/gld.pid`

		It will dump its current state and then stop.

		The greylist daemon does not need to be root to run,
		although it does need write access to its state files and
		pid file.

		The gld-mcp program is used to manage the server process
		(although you can't use it to stop gld).
	
		To run the gld-map program:

			# /usr/local/bin/gld-mcp

		(at the gld-mcp prompt, type 'help' for more information)

	Postfix:

		Edit '/etc/postfix/master.cf' to include the following line:

		---[ line to add ]----------------

		policy unix - n n - - spawn user=nobody argv=/usr/local/bin/pfc

		---[ end of line ]------------------

		You will also need to add 

			check_policy_service unix:private/policy

		to the smtpd_recipient_restrictions line in
		'/etc/postfix/main.cf'.  Then restart Postfix.

	Sendmail:

		You need to make sure the 'smc' program is running before
		sendmail starts.  To start smc:

			# /usr/local/bin/smc

		And to stop smc:

			# kill `cat /var/run/smc.pid`

		To configure sendmail to use smc, add the following to
		'/etc/mail/sendmail.mc':

		---[ line to add ]---------------------------------

		define (`_FFR_MILTER', `1')dnl.
		INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`filter', `S=unix:/var/state/gld/milter')

		---[ end of line ]---------------------------------

		Then run make in '/etc/mail'.  That will regenerate
		'/etc/mail/sendmail.cf'.  Then restart sendmail.

Example Setups:

	Running the clients and server on the same system:  just run as-is. 
	This is the default setting of the greylist daemon.

	Running the client on one host, the greylist daemon on another host:
	run the client(s) as:

		# ./pfc --server gldserver
		# ./smc --server gldserver
		# ./gld-mcp --server gldserver

	On the machine running gld, start the process as:

		# ./gld --host 0.0.0.0

	if you want it to accept connections on all available interfaces. If
	you only want to accept requests on a specific interface, specify
	the IP address of that interface:

		# ./gld --host gldserver

	The server can only accept requests from all interfaces (using
	"0.0.0.0" or the one specified interface.

	You can have multiple clients all communicating to a common server.

Restricting access:

	The best way is to run both the server and clients on the same box.
	All communications happen over the loopback address.  If that's not
	desirable, then you can run the server on a private IP address.  If
	you need to run the server process on a public port, then you'll
	need to use other methods to restrict access (such as a firewall). 
	The greylist daemon does not have facilities for restricting access
	at this time.

Managing the server:

	By default, there's no filtering in the IP address.  You may want to
	consider doing so.  Take a look at the files "lists/whitelist.ip"
	and "lists/whitelist_ip.txt", which are a list of IP addresses of
	problematic SMTP hosts that have problems with greylisting. 
	"lists/whitelist_ip.txt" is from

<http://cvs.puremagic.com/viewcvs/*checkout*/greylisting/schema/whitelist_ip.txt>

	which have been collected over several years.  The othe file,
	"lists/whitelist.ip", is a bunch I've discovered over the few months
	in developing this software, and contains wider groupings of
	netblocks.  You won't go too wrong with using the following:

  GenericUnixPrompt> gld-mcp iplist file path/to/whitelist.ip
  GenericUnixPrompt> gld-mcp iplist file path/to/whitelist_ip.txt relaydelay

	The files "lists/bogon-bn-nonagg.txt" and
	"lists/bogons-cidr-all.txt" contain netblocks of unallocated network
	space.  Emperical testing on 600,000 tuples showed that adding these
	to the IPlist in the greylist daemon wasn't worth it. See
	<http://boston.conman.org/2007/10/12.1> for more information.

	See the file RUNNING for more on how to manage the server.
