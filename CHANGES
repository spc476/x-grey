                built in a different directory.

	* ALL: Update the code to remove custom integer types
               and use C99 standard ints instead, to better clarify   
               intent.

	* ALL: Official announcement:  ignore any pleas that this
               is the last release of this version.  Also ignore any pleas
               that this is the last release, period.  Obviously, I can't 
               make up my mind on this.

	       reproduce it.

	* ALL: Official announcement:  this is the LAST 1.0 release.
	       This may be the last release, period.

		* Version information is generated during make from
		  the revision control software.

		* Follow GNU advice about building with $(prefix) and

1.0.14	2011-12-04

	* ALL: Fixed core dump because of code I should have removed but
               didn't.

	* GLD: don't write PID file if using --nomonitor

1.0.13	2011-11-27

	* GLD: new metrics, such as:

		* # times read tuplespace
		* # times write tuplespace
		* low tuple mark
		* high tuple mark

	* GLD: faster cleanup of tuplespace

	* GLD: better self-monitoring in case of segfault, etc.

	* ALL: Now C99!

	* GLD: fixed a tuplespace corruption bug

	* GLD: fixed a parsing bug when reading the whitelist on startup

	* GLD: call madvise() to let kernel know we're hitting the tuple
               space randomly

	* GLD: fixed output bug

	* ALL: New Makefiles.  No longer do we use recursive Makefiles.

	* GLD: Removed the following command line arguments as they were
	       very seldom used:

			--whitelist
			--greylist / --graylist
			--max-tuples
			--time-cleanup
			--time-checkpoint
			--timeout-embargo
			--timeout-grey / --timeout-gray
			--timeout-white
			--iplist
			--time-format
			--report-format
			--log-facility
			--log-level
			--log-id
			--secret
			--old-counts

	* GLD: added command line option "--nomonitor"

	* GLD: expired tuples logged via syslog

1.0.12	2010-05-10

	* Now you can uninstall the program!

	* ALL: Version number is now pulled from source control.  Yea!

	* GLD: fixed a segfault when it received so many requests it filled
	  up the tuple array (not that I didn't check for that---I did, it's
	  just that I reset the master index to 0 and forgot to check for
	  that when adding a new tuple)

	* GLD: Forgot to send back an error condition to the MCP in
	  one case.

	* PFC: Fixed an issue that filtered out logging messages.

	* ALL: Added sequence numbers to all logged messages.

	* ALL: Added a more pedantic value for the number of seconds in a
	  year.

1.0.11	2009-12-10

	* Removed calls to exit() that should not have been there.

1.0.10	2009-12-01

	* GLD: Changed startup behaviorâ€”it now clears all counts from the
	  saved state when starting up; use the --old-counts option to
	  retain old behavior.

	* PFC: Added an extra space in logging output.

	* PFC: Changed some logging from level info to debug.

	* Make sure that we only log messages at or below our current
	  logging level (set via the --log-level option).

	* Changed default system logging facility from local5 and local6 to
	  mail; use the --log-facility option if you want to retain old
	  facilities.

	* Added -Wextra and -ansi compiler options, and cleaning up code to
	  remove warnings.

1.0.9	2009-05-23

	* Fixed a potential bug in the binary search routines. See
	  http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html
	  for more information.

1.0.8	2009-03-26

	* Changed nearly all occurances of 'gray' (regardless of case) to
	  'grey' (yes, I'm anal like that).

	* Fixed the clean target in a few make files.

1.0.7	2009-02-17

	* GLD: I used to ignore EINTR when calling accept() for
	  a bulk data transfer.  This was *not* the thing to do.  I
	  also limit the time for the accept() to 10 seconds.

1.0.6	2008-04-16

	* SMC: Set default stack to 64k

	* SMC: made sure calls to setrlimit(RLIMIT_STACK) actually
	  take affect (effect?) by exec() itself after the call;
	  apparently, the pthread initialization may take place
	  before main() is called, and thus limiting the stack size
	  afterwards won't do any good.

1.0.5	2008-03-24

	* Fixed a typo in the INSTALL file.

	* Fixed a bug in SMC where if the user authenticated, they would
	  still get greylisted.

1.0.4

	* Fixed removed a spurious space in the lines added to 
	  sendmail.mc

1.0.3	2007-11-13

	* Fixed an inconsistency in the INSTALL file.

	* Added an omitted step when installing the Postfix client.

	* Fixed a segfault in PFC.

1.0.2	2007-11-06

	* Fixed some segfaults in the handling of commands in the MCP.

	* Changed a "return;" to "_exit(0);" in cmd_mcp_report().

	* Set default stack in SMC to 1M.

	* Added version information to each program.

	* Made sure all fields in the packets were initialized before
	  calculating the CRC.

	* MCP:  if it can't find the pager program in interactive mode, uses
	  the internal pager.

	* Some more documenation written.

1.0.1	2007-11-03

	* Fixed datatypes relating to the network protocol on 64b systems.

	* GCC on OpenBSD dosn't like compiling into 'obj/'.

	* Removed Linux specific headers.

	* Fixed some dodgy, not quite legal C code relating to networking.

	* Initial release.
