1.0.8	2009-03-26

	* Changed nearly all occurances of 'gray' (regardless of case) to
	  'grey' (yes, I'm anal like that).

	* Fixed the clean targer in a few make files.

1.0.7	2009-02-17

	* GLD: I used to ignore EINTR when calling accept() for
	  a bulk data transfer.  This was *not* the thing to do.  I
	  also limit the time for the accept() to 10 seconds.

1.0.6	2008-04-16

	* SMC: Set default stack to 64k

	* SMC: made sure calls to setrlimit(RLIMIT_STACK) actually
	  take affect (effect?) by exec() itself after the call;
	  apparently, the pthread initialization may take place
	  before main() is called, and thus limiting the stack size
	  afterwards won't do any good.

1.0.5	2008-03-24

	* Fixed a typo in the INSTALL file.

	* Fixed a bug in SMC where if the user authenticated, they would
	  still get greylisted.

1.0.4

	* Fixed removed a spurious space in the lines added to 
	  sendmail.mc

1.0.3	2007-11-13

	* Fixed an inconsistency in the INSTALL file.

	* Added an omitted step when installing the Postfix client.

	* Fixed a segfault in PFC.

1.0.2	2007-11-06

	* Fixed some segfaults in the handling of commands in the MCP.

	* Changed a "return;" to "_exit(0);" in cmd_mcp_report().

	* Set default stack in SMC to 1M.

	* Added version information to each program.

	* Made sure all fields in the packets were initialized before
	  calculating the CRC.

	* MCP:  if it can't find the pager program in interactive mode, uses
	  the internal pager.

	* Some more documenation written.

1.0.1	2007-11-03

	* Fixed datatypes relating to the network protocol on 64b systems.

	* GCC on OpenBSD dosn't like compiling into 'obj/'.

	* Removed Linux specific headers.

	* Fixed some dodgy, not quite legal C code relating to networking.

1.0.0	2007-11-01
	* Initial release.
